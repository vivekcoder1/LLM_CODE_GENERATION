# CODEBASE COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS & API REFERENCE

## 1. PRIMARY PUBLIC API ENDPOINTS (PREFER USING THESE)

### [Class] UniformGrid
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.UniformGrid`

**Usage:** `from phi.flow.UniformGrid import UniformGrid; UniformGrid(...)` or direct instantiation from phi.flow

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
An instance of UniformGrid represents all cells of a regular grid as a batch of boxes.
```

### [Function] explicit
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.diffuse.explicit`

**Usage:** `diffuse.explicit(...)` or `from phi.flow.diffuse import explicit; explicit(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Explicit Euler diffusion with substeps.

Simulate a finite-time diffusion process of the form dF/dt = α · ΔF on a given `Field` Field with diffusion coefficient α.

Args:
    u: CenteredGrid, StaggeredGrid or ConstantField
    diffusivity: Diffusion per time. `diffusion_amount = diffusivity * dt`
        Can be a number, `phi.Tensor` or `phi.field.Field`.
        If a channel dimension is present, it will be interpreted as non-isotropic diffusion.
    dt: Time interval. `diffusion_amount = diffusivity * dt`
    substeps: number of iterations to use (Default value = 1)
    order: Spatial order of accuracy.
        Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
        Supported: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.laplace()`).
        For FVM, the order is used when interpolating `v` and `prev_v` to cell faces if needed.
    implicit: When a `Solve` object is passed, performs a spatially implicit operation with the specified solver and tolerances.
        Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.
    gradient: Only used by FVM at the moment. Approximate gradient of `u`, e.g. ∇u of the previous time step.
        If `None`, approximates the gradient as `(u_neighbor - u_self) / distance`.
    upwind: For unstructured meshes only. Whether to use upwind interpolation.
    correct_skew: If `True`, adds a correction term for cell skewness. This requires `gradient` to be passed.

Returns:
    Diffused field of same type as `field`.
```

### [Function] StaggeredGrid
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.StaggeredGrid`

**Usage:** `flow.StaggeredGrid(...)` or `from phi.flow import StaggeredGrid; StaggeredGrid(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
N-dimensional grid whose vector components are sampled at the respective face centers.
A staggered grid is defined through its values tensor, its bounds describing the physical size, and its extrapolation.

Staggered grids support batch and spatial dimensions but only one channel dimension for the staggered vector components.

    `CenteredGrid`,
    `Grid`,
    `Field`,
    `Field`,
    module documentation at https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Fields.html

Args:
    values: Values to use for the grid.
        Has to be one of the following:

        * `phi.geom.Geometry`: sets inside values to 1, outside to 0
        * `Field`: resamples the Field to the staggered sample points
        * `Number`: uses the value for all sample points
        * `tuple` or `list`: interprets the sequence as vector, used for all sample points
        * `phi.math.Tensor` with staggered shape: uses tensor values as grid values.
          Must contain a `vector` dimension with each slice consisting of one more element along the dimension they describe.
          Use `phi.math.stack()` to manually create this non-uniform tensor.
        * Function `values(x)` where `x` is a `phi.math.Tensor` representing the physical location.
            The spatial dimensions of the grid will be passed as batch dimensions to the function.

    boundary: The grid extrapolation determines the value outside the `values` tensor.
        Allowed types: `float`, `phi.math.Tensor`, `phi.math.extrapolation.Extrapolation`.
    bounds: Physical size and location of the grid as `phi.geom.Box`.
        If the resolution is determined through `resolution` of `values`, a `float` can be passed for `bounds` to create a unit box.
    resolution: Grid resolution as purely spatial `phi.math.Shape`.
        If `bounds` is given as a `Box`, the resolution may be specified as an `int` to be equal along all axes.
    convert: Whether to convert `values` to the default backend.
    **resolution_: Spatial dimensions as keyword arguments. Typically either `resolution` or `spatial_dims` are specified.
```

### [Class] Field
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.Field`

**Usage:** `from phi.flow.Field import Field; Field(...)` or direct instantiation from phi.flow

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
A `Field` represents a discretized physical quantity (like temperature field or velocity field).
The sample points and their relation are encoded in the `geometry` property and the corresponding values are stored as one `Tensor` in `values`.
The boundary conditions and values outside the geometry are determined by `boundary`.

Examples:
    Create a periodic 2D grid, initialized via noise fluctuations.
    >>> Field(UniformGrid(x=32, y=32), values=Noise(), boundary=PERIODIC)

    Create a field on an unstructured mesh loaded from a .gmsh file
    >>> mesh = phi.geom.load_gmsh('cylinder.msh', ('y-', 'x+', 'y+', 'x-', 'cyl+', 'cyl-'))
    >>> Field(mesh, values=vec(x=1, y=0), boundary={'x': ZERO_GRADIENT, 'y': 0, 'cyl': 0})

    Create two cubes and compute a scalar values for each.
    >>> Field(Cuboid(vec(x=[0, 2], y=0), x=1, y=1), values=lambda x,y: x)

See the `phi.field` module documentation at https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Fields.html
```

### [Function] CenteredGrid
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.CenteredGrid`

**Usage:** `flow.CenteredGrid(...)` or `from phi.flow import CenteredGrid; CenteredGrid(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Create an n-dimensional grid with values sampled at the cell centers.
A centered grid is defined through its `CenteredGrid.values` `phi.math.Tensor`, its `CenteredGrid.bounds` `phi.geom.Box` describing the physical size, and its `CenteredGrid.extrapolation` (`phi.math.extrapolation.Extrapolation`).

Centered grids support batch, spatial and channel dimensions.

    `StaggeredGrid`,
    `Grid`,
    `Field`,
    `Field`,
    module documentation at https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Fields.html

        * `phi.math.Tensor` compatible with grid dims: uses tensor values as grid values
        * Function `values(x)` where `x` is a `phi.math.Tensor` representing the physical location.
            The spatial dimensions of the grid will be passed as batch dimensions to the function.

    extrapolation: The grid extrapolation determines the value outside the `values` tensor.
        Allowed types: `float`, `phi.math.Tensor`, `phi.math.extrapolation.Extrapolation`.

### [Class] Geometry
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.Geometry`

**Usage:** `from phi.flow.Geometry import Geometry; Geometry(...)` or direct instantiation from phi.flow

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Abstract base class for N-dimensional shapes.

Main implementing classes:

* `Sphere`
* `Box`
* `Cylinder`
* `Graph`
* `Mesh`
* `Heightmap`
* `SDFGrid`
* `SDF`
* `SplineSheet`

All geometry objects support batching.
Thereby any parameter defining the geometry can be varied along arbitrary batch dims.
All batch dimensions are listed in Geometry.shape.

Property getters (`@property`, such as `shape`), save for getters, must not depend on any variables marked as *variable* via `__variable_attrs__()` as these may be `None` during tracing.
Equality checks must also take this into account.
```

### [Class] Mesh
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.Mesh`

**Usage:** `from phi.flow.Mesh import Mesh; Mesh(...)` or direct instantiation from phi.flow

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Unstructured mesh, consisting of vertices and elements.

Use `phi.geom.mesh()` or `phi.geom.mesh_from_numpy()` to construct a mesh manually or `phi.geom.load_su2()` to load one from a file.
```

### [Function] mac_cormack
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.advect.mac_cormack`

**Usage:** `advect.mac_cormack(...)` or `from phi.flow.advect import mac_cormack; mac_cormack(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
MacCormack advection uses a forward and backward lookup to determine the first-order error of semi-Lagrangian advection.
It then uses that error estimate to correct the field values.
To avoid overshoots, the resulting value is bounded by the neighbouring grid cells of the backward lookup.

Args:
    field: Field to be advected, one of `(CenteredGrid, StaggeredGrid)`
    velocity: Vector field, need not be sampled at same locations as `field`.
    dt: Time increment
    correction_strength: The estimated error is multiplied by this factor before being applied.
        The case correction_strength=0 equals semi-lagrangian advection. Set lower than 1.0 to avoid oscillations.
    integrator: ODE integrator for solving the movement.

Returns:
    Advected field of type `type(field)`
```
