### [File] fluid.py
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.fluid.py`

### [Class] Field
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.Field`

**Usage:** `from phi.flow.Field import Field; Field(...)` or direct instantiation from phi.flow

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
A `Field` represents a discretized physical quantity (like temperature field or velocity field).
The sample points and their relation are encoded in the `geometry` property and the corresponding values are stored as one `Tensor` in `values`.
The boundary conditions and values outside the geometry are determined by `boundary`.

Examples:
    Create a periodic 2D grid, initialized via noise fluctuations.
    >>> Field(UniformGrid(x=32, y=32), values=Noise(), boundary=PERIODIC)

    Create a field on an unstructured mesh loaded from a .gmsh file
    >>> mesh = phi.geom.load_gmsh('cylinder.msh', ('y-', 'x+', 'y+', 'x-', 'cyl+', 'cyl-'))
    >>> Field(mesh, values=vec(x=1, y=0), boundary={'x': ZERO_GRADIENT, 'y': 0, 'cyl': 0})

    Create two cubes and compute a scalar values for each.
    >>> Field(Cuboid(vec(x=[0, 2], y=0), x=1, y=1), values=lambda x,y: x)

See the `phi.field` module documentation at https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Fields.html

```

### [Method] boundary_faces
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.Geometry.boundary_faces`

**Signature/Docstring:**

        Has to be one of the following:

        * `phi.geom.Geometry`: sets inside values to 1, outside to 0
        * `Field`: resamples the Field to the staggered sample points

        If the resolution is determined through `resolution` of `values`, a `float` can be passed for `bounds` to create a unit box.
    resolution: Grid resolution as purely spatial `phi.math.Shape`.
        If `bounds` is given as a `Box`, the resolution may be specified as an `int` to be equal along all axes.

### [Function] differential
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.advect.differential`

**Usage:** `advect.differential(...)` or `from phi.flow.advect import differential; differential(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Computes the differential advection term using the differentiation Scheme indicated by `order`, ´implicit´ and `upwind`.

For a velocity field u, the advection term as it appears on the right-hand-side of a PDE is -u·∇u, including the negative sign.

For unstructured meshes, computes -1/V ∑_f (n·u_prev) u ρ A

Args:
    u: Scalar or vector-valued `Field` sampled on a `CenteredGrid`, `StaggeredGrid` or `Mesh`.
    velocity: `Field` that can be sampled at the elements of `u`.
        For FVM, the advection term is typically linearized by setting `velocity = previous_velocity`.
        Passing `velocity=u` yields non-linear terms which cannot be traced inside linear functions.
    order: Spatial order of accuracy.
        Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
        Supported for grids: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.spatial_gradient()` and resampling).
        Passing order=4 currently uses 2nd-order resampling. This is work-in-progress.
        For FVM, the order is used when interpolating centroid values to faces if needed.
    implicit: When a `Solve` object is passed, performs an implicit operation with the specified solver and tolerances.
        Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.
    upwind: Whether to use upwind interpolation. Only supported for FVM at the moment.

Returns:
    Differential convection term as `Field` on the same geometry.

**Usage:** `advect.mac_cormack(...)` or `from phi.flow.advect import mac_cormack; mac_cormack(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
MacCormack advection uses a forward and backward lookup to determine the first-order error of semi-Lagrangian advection.
It then uses that error estimate to correct the field values.
To avoid overshoots, the resulting value is bounded by the neighbouring grid cells of the backward lookup.

Args:
    field: Field to be advected, one of `(CenteredGrid, StaggeredGrid)`
    velocity: Vector field, need not be sampled at same locations as `field`.

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Compute the differential diffusion term, d·∇²u.
For grids, uses a finite difference scheme specified by `order` and `implicit`.
For FVM, the scheme is specified via `order` and `upwind`.

In contrast to `explicit` and `implicit`, accuracy can be increased by using stencils of higher-order rather than calculating sub-steps.

    order: Spatial order of accuracy.
        Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
        Supported: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.laplace()`).
        For FVM, the order is used when interpolating `v` and `prev_v` to cell faces if needed.
    implicit: When a `Solve` object is passed, performs an implicit operation with the specified solver and tolerances.
        Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.
    upwind: For unstructured meshes only. Whether to use upwind interpolation.
    correct_skew: If `True`, adds a correction term for cell skewness. This requires `gradient` to be passed.

Returns:
    Differential diffusion as a `Field` on the same geometry.

        For FVM, the order is used when interpolating `v` and `prev_v` to cell faces if needed.

        Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.

    upwind: For unstructured meshes only. Whether to use upwind interpolation.
    correct_skew: If `True`, adds a correction term for cell skewness. This requires `gradient` to be passed.

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Implements the 4th-order Runge-Kutta time advancement scheme for incompressible vector fields.
This approach is inspired by [Kampanis et. al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999105005061) and incorporates the pressure treatment into the time step.

Args:
    pde: Momentum equation. Function that computes all PDE terms not related to pressure, e.g. diffusion, advection, external forces.
    velocity: Velocity grid at time `t`.
    pressure: Pressure at time `t`.
    dt: Time increment to integrate.
    pressure_order: spatial order for derivative computations.
        For Higher-order schemes, the laplace operation is not conducted with a stencil exactly corresponding to the one used in divergence calculations but a smaller one instead.
        While this disrupts the formal correctness of the method it only induces insignificant errors and yields considerable performance gains.
        supported: explicit 2/4th order - implicit 6th order (obstacles are only supported with explicit 2nd order)
    pressure_solve: `Solve` object specifying method and tolerances for the implicit pressure solve.

    obstacles: `Obstacle` or `phi.geom.Geometry` or tuple/list thereof to specify boundary conditions inside the domain.
    solve: `Solve` object specifying method and tolerances for the implicit pressure solve.
    active: (Optional) Mask for which cells the pressure should be solved.
        If given, the velocity may take `NaN` values where it does not contribute to the pressure.
        Also, the total divergence will never be subtracted if active is given, even if all values are 1.
    order: spatial order for derivative computations.
        For Higher-order schemes, the laplace operation is not conducted with a stencil exactly corresponding to the one used in divergence calculations but a smaller one instead.
        While this disrupts the formal correctness of the method it only induces insignificant errors and yields considerable performance gains.
        supported: explicit 2/4th order - implicit 6th order (obstacles are only supported with explicit 2nd order)

Returns:
    velocity: divergence-free velocity of type `type(velocity)`
    pressure: solved pressure field, `CenteredGrid`
```

### [Function] masked_laplace
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.fluid.masked_laplace`

**Usage:** `fluid.masked_laplace(...)` or `from phi.flow.fluid import masked_laplace; masked_laplace(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python

Args:
    pressure: Pressure field.
    hard_bcs: Mask encoding which cells are connected to each other.
        One between fluid cells, zero inside and at the boundary of obstacles.
        This should be of the same type as the velocity, i.e. `StaggeredGrid` or `CenteredGrid`.
    active: Mask indicating for which cells the pressure value is valid.
        Linear solves will only determine the pressure for these cells.
        This is generally zero inside obstacles and in non-simulated regions.
    order: Spatial order of accuracy.
        Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
        Supported: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.laplace()`).

Returns:
    `CenteredGrid`
```
