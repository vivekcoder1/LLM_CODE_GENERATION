Simulate a finite-time diffusion process of the form dF/dt = α · ΔF on a given `Field` Field with diffusion coefficient α.

Args:
    u: CenteredGrid, StaggeredGrid or ConstantField
    diffusivity: Diffusion per time. `diffusion_amount = diffusivity * dt`
        Can be a number, `phi.Tensor` or `phi.field.Field`.

### [Class] Field
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.Field`

**Usage:** `from phi.flow.Field import Field; Field(...)` or direct instantiation from phi.flow

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
A `Field` represents a discretized physical quantity (like temperature field or velocity field).
The sample points and their relation are encoded in the `geometry` property and the corresponding values are stored as one `Tensor` in `values`.
The boundary conditions and values outside the geometry are determined by `boundary`.

Examples:
    Create a periodic 2D grid, initialized via noise fluctuations.
    >>> Field(UniformGrid(x=32, y=32), values=Noise(), boundary=PERIODIC)

    Create a field on an unstructured mesh loaded from a .gmsh file
    >>> mesh = phi.geom.load_gmsh('cylinder.msh', ('y-', 'x+', 'y+', 'x-', 'cyl+', 'cyl-'))
    >>> Field(mesh, values=vec(x=1, y=0), boundary={'x': ZERO_GRADIENT, 'y': 0, 'cyl': 0})

    Create two cubes and compute a scalar values for each.
    >>> Field(Cuboid(vec(x=[0, 2], y=0), x=1, y=1), values=lambda x,y: x)

    active: Mask indicating for which cells the pressure value is valid.
        Linear solves will only determine the pressure for these cells.
        This is generally zero inside obstacles and in non-simulated regions.

### [Function] mac_cormack
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.advect.mac_cormack`

**Usage:** `advect.mac_cormack(...)` or `from phi.flow.advect import mac_cormack; mac_cormack(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
MacCormack advection uses a forward and backward lookup to determine the first-order error of semi-Lagrangian advection.
It then uses that error estimate to correct the field values.
To avoid overshoots, the resulting value is bounded by the neighbouring grid cells of the backward lookup.

Args:
    field: Field to be advected, one of `(CenteredGrid, StaggeredGrid)`
    velocity: Vector field, need not be sampled at same locations as `field`.
    dt: Time increment
    correction_strength: The estimated error is multiplied by this factor before being applied.
        The case correction_strength=0 equals semi-lagrangian advection. Set lower than 1.0 to avoid oscillations.
    integrator: ODE integrator for solving the movement.

Returns:
    Advected field of type `type(field)`
```

### [Function] differential
**Import Path:** `phi.flow.advect.differential`

**Usage:** `advect.differential(...)` or `from phi.flow.advect import differential; differential(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Computes the differential advection term using the differentiation Scheme indicated by `order`, ´implicit´ and `upwind`.

For a velocity field u, the advection term as it appears on the right-hand-side of a PDE is -u·∇u, including the negative sign.

For unstructured meshes, computes -1/V ∑_f (n·u_prev) u ρ A

Args:
    u: Scalar or vector-valued `Field` sampled on a `CenteredGrid`, `StaggeredGrid` or `Mesh`.
    velocity: `Field` that can be sampled at the elements of `u`.
        For FVM, the advection term is typically linearized by setting `velocity = previous_velocity`.
        Passing `velocity=u` yields non-linear terms which cannot be traced inside linear functions.
    order: Spatial order of accuracy.
        Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
        Supported for grids: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.spatial_gradient()` and resampling).
        Passing order=4 currently uses 2nd-order resampling. This is work-in-progress.
        For FVM, the order is used when interpolating centroid values to faces if needed.
    implicit: When a `Solve` object is passed, performs an implicit operation with the specified solver and tolerances.
        Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.
    upwind: Whether to use upwind interpolation. Only supported for FVM at the moment.

Returns:
    Differential convection term as `Field` on the same geometry.

**Usage:** `advect.semi_lagrangian(...)` or `from phi.flow.advect import semi_lagrangian; semi_lagrangian(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Semi-Lagrangian advection with simple backward lookup.

This method samples the `velocity` at the grid points of `field`
to determine the lookup location for each grid point by walking backwards along the velocity vectors.
The new values are then determined by sampling `field` at these lookup locations.

Args:
    field: quantity to be advected, stored on a grid (CenteredGrid or StaggeredGrid)
    velocity: vector field, need not be compatible with with `field`.
    dt: time increment

**Usage:** `diffuse.differential(...)` or `from phi.flow.diffuse import differential; differential(...)`

**Signature/Docstring:**
```python
Compute the differential diffusion term, d·∇²u.
For grids, uses a finite difference scheme specified by `order` and `implicit`.
For FVM, the scheme is specified via `order` and `upwind`.

In contrast to `explicit` and `implicit`, accuracy can be increased by using stencils of higher-order rather than calculating sub-steps.

Args:
    u: Scalar or vector-valued `Field` sampled on a `CenteredGrid`, `StaggeredGrid` or centered `Mesh`.
    diffusivity: Dynamic viscosity, i.e. diffusion per time. Constant or varying by cell.

        If `None`, approximates the gradient as `(u_neighbor - u_self) / distance`.
    order: Spatial order of accuracy.
        Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
        Supported: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.laplace()`).
        For FVM, the order is used when interpolating `v` and `prev_v` to cell faces if needed.
    implicit: When a `Solve` object is passed, performs an implicit operation with the specified solver and tolerances.
        Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.
    upwind: For unstructured meshes only. Whether to use upwind interpolation.
    correct_skew: If `True`, adds a correction term for cell skewness. This requires `gradient` to be passed.

Returns:
    Differential diffusion as a `Field` on the same geometry.
